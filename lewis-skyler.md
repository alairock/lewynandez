Skyler is 28 years old, and is still married to Cynthia! I don&#8217;t think that will ever change. I am in a band, <a href="http://reverbnation.com/adashore" target="_blank">Adashore</a>Â and I am one of the original software engineersÂ of Canopy. I love spending time with my family and playing live shows.

My name is Skyler Lewis and I am 22 Years old&#8230;..

I absolutely love being married to Cynthia Lewis, and I love her more than anything in this world!

I love music, and drumming, and gadgets. I am pro mac. Windows is so hard to use, and so glitchy! I love my ipod touch, and watching Apple Keynotes,m and programming, and drawing on the computer. Ummm.. and twitter is my new thing too!

I love being married and I have a daughter named Paris Amora. She pretty much thinks I am the best ever. And so does my wife. Yup.

I want to get my business degree, and hopefully I will be able to get really serious about school so that I can make more money!

I love movies and TV, and spending my time outside, and the Beach, and SAN DIEGO!!!!! and did I mention SeaWorld?

Someday I will have a beach house, and I will learn to surf.

Oh and I think being a cop would be neat. ðŸ™‚
