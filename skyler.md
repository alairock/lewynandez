# Skyler

Skyler is 28 years old, and is still married to Cynthia! I don't think that will ever change. I am in a band, [Adashore](http://reverbnation.com/adashore) and I am one of the original software engineers of Canopy. I love spending time with my family and playing live shows.   **In 2009** Umm... My name is Skyler Lewis and I am 22 Years old..... I absolutely love being married to Cynthia Lewis, and I love her more than anything in this world! I love music, and drumming, and gadgets. I am pro mac. Windows is so hard to use, and so glitchy! I love my ipod touch, and watching Apple Keynotes,m and programming, and drawing on the computer. Ummm.. and twitter is my new thing too! I love being married and I have a daughter named Paris Amora. She pretty much thinks I am the best ever. And so does my wife. Yup. I want to get my business degree, and hopefully I will be able to get really serious about school so that I can make more money! I love movies and TV, and spending my time outside, and the Beach, and SAN DIEGO!!!!! and did I mention SeaWorld? Someday I will have a beach house, and I will learn to surf. Oh and I think being a cop would be neat. :)
