So we have less than two months ago and the time is just flying its crazy!

The hardest part about getting married I think is dedicating yourself to saving money and losing weight. I dont care how much you say you disagree, but its true for everyone I think. I know I dont want to walk out on the beach with a gut, unless its six sqaure guts all perfectly aligned.

On another note, we went and saw thrice last night and I must say they are amazing every single last time!
