It has been a while since I have been on here to say anything. Well to say the least things have been crazy. Lots of stress and lots of work and school. We both really need a break for sure and do not see one in sight. The good news is Halloween is tomorrow. We will be spending most of the day at the library studying but we are going to be making a pit stop at the inlaws and to my parents house to show off Paris costume. She is going to be a giraffe! And she loonks so cute in it! Mom is going to be lil red riding hood. And I am going to be one of those guys from the 20s. 

Well that&#8217;s it for now. Time to go spend some amazing time with my amazing perfect beautiful wife!!!!!!!!Â¡Â¡Â¡!!Â¡!!!Â¡ ps she&#8217;s hot! ðŸ™‚
