Life has been so crazy. We were having a great time celebrating Skyler&#8217;s birthday[[Lunch at Zupas, Shopping and watching the Lion King at the dollar theater]] we were wrapping things up with dinner at Noodle&#8217;s & Company [[his pick]] and on to cake and presents at my parents house. BUT&#8230; as soon as we had ordered our food and sat down my padre called. Wondering if he could still make it to dinner, I started staring off into space and could not move my gaze. I could hear my dad asking me if I was still on the phone. I wanted to tell him &#8220;Yeah I&#8217;m still here&#8221; the words were in my head but they would not come out of my mouth. I could feel my body locking up, I couldn&#8217;t move. Skyler came and grabbed my shoulders and asked me if I was okay. Once again I couldn&#8217;t respond. I was becoming more and more scared by the second. Then everything went black. When I woke up I was in the ER. I don&#8217;t remember getting in an ambulance or getting wheeled into the ER. I was in a hospital gown and my shoes, necklace, and shirt were off. [[I had no idea how I got to that point]] I knew I had another seizure, my body ached and my tongue was swollen from me biting on it. I felt terrible that I had ruined Skyler&#8217;s birthday, but he was sitting there right next to me with that worried look in his eyes. We sat in the ER for 4 hours, no answers no nothing. Like usual. So we went home. The next day we had a re-do for Skyler&#8217;s birthday cake and all. I was so glad he could enjoy his cake and everyone that came to wish him a happy birthday.

A few days ago we went to a Neurologist [[lucky us Dr. Brown was able to get us in a day later or else we would have had to wait 3-4 months!]] We went in not expecting any answers [[Mark never got answers]] and we didn&#8217;t get anything but bad news. To prevent me from having another seizure and possibly hurting my children I had to be on medication. Medication meant no more nursing. And I wasn&#8217;t ready for that. I had become fond of the bonding time I had with Lauren while she nursed and I wanted to stop on my own time not because someone was making me. I knew the right answer but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it.  I cried pretty much all week, and today was my last day nursing. I cried as I fed Lauren for the last time. I could still take the medication and nurse but the medicine gets through the breast milk. And I could not risk it getting to Lauren. It could also cause possible birth defects in future children. Which, to be quite honest and frank, broke me. I spent all my life not smoking, drinking, or doing anything that could possibly prevent me from having healthy babies. And now I have to depend on something that could cause defects. I had limitations. But the fear of not wanting to get out of bed because at any moment I could seize  and harm Paris and Lauren out weighed nursing. The defect bridge would have to be crossed when I came to it, we still have no solution. I have felt broken all week, but thankfully I had such great friends and family to lean on. [[Mom Dad Marky Kelsey Sarah thank you all I love you with all my heart.]] Most especially Grandma Petra who had long talks with me and Skyler who let me cry on him for hours on in.

I dont know what the future holds but hopefully it is seizure free.
