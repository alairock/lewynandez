**Day 11- A picture of something you dislike.**

(as you can tell I&#8217;m terrible at keeping up with this)

The thing I dislike the most&#8230;HATE even, is racism. Of any kind. Discrimination to me is disgusting. I dont understand why people must look down on one another because they look different/believe different/live different. Why can&#8217;t we look at peoples hearts and intentions? Why can&#8217;t we see that that person is someone else&#8217;s brother/sister/mother/father/best friend? That they are loved. We are all loved. 
  
I think everyone should like everyone.
