**Day 06- A hobby you have.**

I&#8217;m in love with Imagery. How a single photograph can bring someone to tears and overwhelmed with emotions, or bring back sweet memories. I love looking at the mounds of photographs my grandma has, I could quite literally look at pictures for hours. Which is why I guess I love taking pictures so I can always have some to look back on.
