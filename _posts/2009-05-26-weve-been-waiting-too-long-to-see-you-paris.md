Tomorrow is the big day
  
And me and dad are both so excited and nervous at the same time!! =]
  
Today me and my mom went on a walk around the neighborhood and I was explaining to her about how odd and surreal it felt that tomorrow was the big day.
  
Like the day before our wedding, we had been waiting for it for so long it almost seemed like we should be waiting longer.
  
Both of our families and our friends are really excited which is so great!
  
Paris has so many people that already love her and she isnt even here yet!
  
Me and Skyler are a bit nervous, only because we have never done this before!
  
We probably wont be able to sleep tonight!
  
But we should have an update within the next couple of days with pictures of Princess Paris and hopefully a collage of my pregnancy!
  
We love you all
