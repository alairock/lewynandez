We went to our 20 week ultrasound today even though now I am 21 weeks. Apparently baby is a crazy sleeper like her mom cause she had her feet well over her head the entire time. Ultrasounds are quite amazing actually, because you can see a lot of her organs now like the 4 chambers of her heart and her diaphram, kidneys, stomach, spine, and her brain. It was great being able to see baby again.

On a sad note we had to say bye bye to our Korean friend Bitna who is going back to Korea early tomorrow morning. 🙁 We will miss her lots.
