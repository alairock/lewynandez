Not an update, not this time.

Really I just wanted to say, awesome, we have been blogging for almost 4 years. There was probably 10 plus entries that we lost at the very beginning, and that makes me really sad. I really wish that I would have been able to save those, because they were about my lovely future* wife and I when we were first dating. That would have completed it so grandly. 

Anyways, I love you Cynthia, I always have and I always will, and I hope that by reading this blog, this would be proof of that. ðŸ™‚

Love you
  
Skyler
