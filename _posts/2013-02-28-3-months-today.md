    Last night Jake was in my dream. He was sitting with us in our front room like he had so many times since we moved into this home. We were all laughing and telling stories. Everyone was happy and smiling. And I remember looking over seeing Jake smiling at everyone around him. I thought he looked so calm and peaceful. I didn&#8217;t want to leave that moment. The comfort of its familiarity. But as my dream faded and the reality set in once again that Jake was gone the feeling of seeing him calm and at peace stayed with me.

    Through all of this sadness, hurt and confusion.. I have to remember&#8230;

    <strong>He is calm. He is at peace.</strong>
