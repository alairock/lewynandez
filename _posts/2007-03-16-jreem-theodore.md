Lots of stuff is happening. I dont really want to get into the thick of it.

Pretty much my band is going awesome. Jave isnt in it anymore, but thats okay, we are moving in a different direction anyhow.

There is a girl that I really like, and has told me she likes me…. but we will see where this goes. Hopefully it helps me get over this other girl i know. I’ll probably put pics of us on here soon.

My new job is going really awesome… and the longer I am there, the more I like it, I was kinda sketchy about it at first, but now its all good, and I am getting good at all the new stuff I have had to learn. I am dealing alot with our pressman, and making plates, and dealing with color and all that good stuff, which is just something that swift didnt really care too much about, so yay! Hopefully I am getting what I need to get a good job for myself in the future. <img alt=":D" src="http://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20080913021605im_/http://dryearth.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif?w=793" data-recalc-dims="1" />

I bought Zildian A Customs. They’re the shit.
