**Day 20- If you had 3 wishes, what would they be.**

Really though wish 1 would be to have no debt&#8230;EVER.

**WISH 2-** To own our dream house outright. No loans no nothing!

**WISH 3-** To not work but have enough to live comfortably and for a few extra unexpected expenses. So Skyler and I can watch our girls grow up together.
