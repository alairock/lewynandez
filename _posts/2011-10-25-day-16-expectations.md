<pre><strong>Day 16- Something you could live without.</strong></pre>

<pre><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/lewynandez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/expectations1.jpg" rel="lightbox[493]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-494" title="expectations1" src="http://i2.wp.com/lewynandez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/expectations1.jpg?fit=249%2C241" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> </strong></pre>

<pre>Â I could definitely live without expectations. I just want to live my life the way I</pre>

<pre>want to. I want to fall when I'm supposed to or get lost if I'm supposed to.</pre>

<pre>How else am I gonna learn? Expectations only make me feel like I'm letting someone</pre>

<pre>down. And who wants to feel like that?</pre>
