Its crazy right now. Im going to keep this short cause its late.

I am going through a lot. Work is really stressful, and I dont know what I am going to do about it just yet.

I start school in a few weeks&#8230;. maybe. Ive got a lot to do before I can get back in there. I had a bad semester, and they dont like you to have bad semesters. But we&#8217;ll see. Ive got a lot to do there.

Trying to also get cynthia to school, and we have a lot to do there too. But we&#8217;ll get that, and that could actually help me get back into school too! So yeah&#8230;

We just got a new mattress! Its so nice! We absolutely love it! Its our first major buy as a family, and it was a fun experience. It was great cause we were able to put my grandma pulleys quilt she made us on it! And boy does it look smokin!

Im eventually going to get cynthia a nice Camera so we can do some photography work for some money&#8230; but thats a few months away.

One last thanks to everyone who helped us get up and going with a running start. Til next time.
