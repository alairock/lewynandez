This little angel face is a mischievous one..
  
She is constantly climbing on things and getting into anything in her reach.
  
She loves jumping on our bean bag and I even caught her trying to jump from the ottoman to the couch! She kept saying jump too. But nothing compares to the nightmare I had to deal with yesterday morning! I woke up (the girls were already awake) and thought the girls were still happy enough for me to run to the bathroom without any crying or fussing. Soon after I walked in Paris was knocking on the door saying &#8220;mommy I have to pee!&#8221; so I hurried and left the bathroom to her. When I walked back into the room I saw Lauren chewing on something. I panicked thinking Paris might have given her something she could choke on. Boy was I wrong.. I walk over and was immediately horrified. **_SHE WAS EATING HER OWN POOP!!_** Somehow she had managed to open one side of her diaper and found what was inside. I quickly grabbed a wipe and took it from her. Then I pulled her out and changed her diaper. _[on the verge of vomiting the entire time]_ After she was changed I pulled her clothes off and went to wash her hands with soap and repeatedly cleaned her mouth out with some baby toothpaste. It was seriously the worst day ever. I had hoped it would never happen to me..
  
But that little girl is so smart and has even started talking and signing.

So today Paris thought it would be a good idea to kick her sister.. Several times! And the rule is.. If you hit sister you get a time out right away. As she was sitting there Lauren came around the bench and saw Paris sitting there with her arms folded. Lauren smiled **really** big and joined Paris against the wall. It was the cutest thing ever.

Meanwhile any spare time I have had I&#8217;ve been working on this drawing. I&#8217;ve been working on it for days and I want to frame it when I&#8217;m done. 

Until next time!
