When I was a little girl my parents took me and Marky to Disneyland. Where my dad bought me a Pocahontas mug.Â  (my favorite movie at the time) And for a long long time it was one of my most prized possessions. It sat in my room on my dresser until I got married. 
  
Now onto the story of why I have two. A few days before our wedding we were moving our stuff into our soon to be new home. Skyler was carrying a box with my mug sitting on top. I told him to be careful with my mug and sure enough as soon as I said it he dropped it. Breaking it into 2 big pieces. Being the big baby I am I started crying; whining about how my dad bought that for me when I was little. Skyler picked up the two pieces and promised he would fix it. A couple of days later he returned with a mug that looked too new to be my damaged mug. He explained that he had searched everywhere on E-Bay for a new mug and somehow he had found one. He quickly bought it and paid extra to have it shipped quickly. My old mug was at his parents house. He had asked his mom to glue it back together. 
  
It really shows how much Skyler loves me and how much of my whining he puts up with. So now I have two special Pocahontas mugs that sit proudly in my kitchen. One from one of the first important men in my life (dad) and one from an even more important man (Skyler) <3
