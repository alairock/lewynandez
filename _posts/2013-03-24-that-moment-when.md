  <br /> You wonder what more you could have done&#8230;<br /> What could you take back? Rewind. And redo.<br /> Could you have been a better friend or sister?<br /> Would it matter? Would it change things?</p>

    I hoped I never had to feel that way. Or be asking myself those questions.<br /> But here I am&#8230;<br /> Wishing I could have done more for Jake.

No matter where his life took him. And even after.)

Needless to say after I found this I cried for hours.)
