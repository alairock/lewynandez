This morning Hubby and I got up at 2:30 AM and went to do Jacen&#8217;s paper route
  
It was his anniversary so we did it for him
  
It was no bueno.
  
We got done around 10 AM
  
And Hubby spilt coffee on me
  
I cried. It wasnt worth the crazy stress.
  
But we got it done!
  
Then we got to have tritip and bacon wrapped shrimp later! 

&&Now Hubby is moving Princess Paris into her own room
  
What is he trying to do to me?!
  
Kill me?!
  
Honestly! Im not ready for this!
  
Not for another month.

&&Now its cuddle time with Hubby
