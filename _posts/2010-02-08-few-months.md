School is rough. I have to write a paper a day pretty much for my ethics and values class and cynthia is taking pretty much the hardest class in college -biology. We also are taking a music class and an english class together. Music has been pretty easy, but english has kicked our butts. No more online classes. We have learned our lesson. 

Paris is getting to be so big! She was just barely squirming around on the floor and all we had to do to take care of her is sit her on the floor and to make sure that she didn&#8217;t go anywhere we didnt want her to go we just put up a wall of a couple of pillows! And now, we cant seem to find a way to keep her in any one location! She is sitting up, almost standing, crawling everywhere and getting into all sorts of mischief. She is even figuring out how to crawl up stairs! She can go all the way up all by herself. Its so insane! 

The other day she was hanging out with us in our front room, and next thing you know she was gone. I could hear some ruffling in the other room, and we were jumped up out of our skin, worried that she might hurt herself or choke on something. We find her in our bedroom next to Cynthia&#8217;s nightstand, with brown stuff all over her mouth! Apparently Cynthia left her M&M&#8217;s on the nightstand and Paris pulled them right off and started eating them! Thank goodness it was just M&M&#8217;s! 

She also is beginning to learn how to open up things, cupboards and things like that. This morning we left out the baby wipes and she opened them up, and started pulling all of them out!

Man&#8230;. Anyways, the other day I decided that I wanted to start a podcast. For now I would just do the podcast by myself or with a friend, but as Paris gets older I thought I might begin doing them with her. Not like interviews with her, but talking with her about politics, news and other fun stuff like that. Patent pending. Nobody take my idea.

Cynthia and I have been watching a lot of house and learning to grow together. We have been working really hard at getting our life together, and are getting closer and closer to going through the temple. Our bishop has now said that if we keep on the path we are on, we should be able to bless Paris (and me getting the Melchizedek priesthood) Then we get sealed in July!

This should pretty much get you back up-to-date. I will write more later. And hopefully more frequent. This should make my posts less sporadic.
