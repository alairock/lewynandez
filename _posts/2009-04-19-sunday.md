Just sitting in our bed being lazy on a Sunday. Cynthia isn&#8217;t really feeling all that great cause she might be getting a cold. So we are taking it easy so we don&#8217;t cause an early labor. 

Also last week we went to the hospitol to start our paperwork for our baby. It&#8217;s all coming so quickly! Meenwhile we also registered for school and are already to go! So early too! We are so good this year! Welp. I guess that&#8217;s all for now.
