**Day 14- A picture of something you ate and 10 confessions.**

1. I freaking love bacon.
  
2. I can&#8217;t wait for MW3 to come out.
  
3. I think potty training is one of the hardest parts about being a parent. 
  
4. I secretly am just waiting for someone to push my buttons so I can throwdown. (haha srry mom&dad)
  
5. I have way too many zombie dreams.
  
6. I like to put my cold feet on Skyler..(he is so warm!)
  
7. I love having 2 girls. It gives me an exuse to buy all the pink princess hello kitty stuff I want! 
  
8. I like to lay on a heater with a blanket during the cold winter mornings. 
  
9. I love watching V for Vendetta for Skyler&#8217;s birthday every year. 
  
10. I never knew how much joy kids would bring into our lives. Its one of those things everyone says but you dont understand until you&#8217;re there.
