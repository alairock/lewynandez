**Day 07- A picture of someone/something that has the biggest impact on you.**

My family of course has the biggest impact on me. Every breath I take is so that I can continue to live for them. I try my best to be a better person for them, so they will be proud of the mother/wife they have. they have shown me that there are still beautiful things in this world and that life is good and worth living. They have taught me to enjoy each moment of every day, to keep cherished memories locked in my heart, to constantly say &#8220;I love you;&#8221; and they have taught me that everything in existence is beyond me, bigger than myself. God is good. And he blesses us with both big and little miracles. We just need to take the time to appreciate and be thankful for them all. (even the hard ones.)
