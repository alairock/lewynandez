**Day 05- A picture of somewhere youâ€™ve been to.**

San Diego.

Our first trip as husband & wife. Our first trip _alone_.

We love looking back on our memories there.

_Going to the zoo. Walking on the beach hand in hand. The Louis Vuitton store (my fav.) Sushi in the out door mall. The Cheesecake Factory our last night there. Watching the sun set from our hotel roof. Sea World and sunburns. Just being husband and wife._

We can&#8217;t wait to go back and take our girls with us. Running away from the waves. Getting lost in the zoo.

Hopefully we will retire there. Because it&#8217;s **_OUR PLACE. <3_**
