I want to start blogging more
  
Keeping record of what we do in our daily lives so we have this to look back on
  
I have too many pictures to put on just one post so I will probably do two or more posts

&&
  
Paris is getting so big! I cannot believe it! She is 4 months and she is loving life! Hubby and I love life with her.
  
She lays in our bed in the morning and sleeps with us.
  
She makes herself and us a mess when she eats her newly favorites Apples, Pears, Carrots, and Bananas
  
She splashes in her baths
  
She smiles and giggles at us
  
Sometimes she laughs at the most random of things
  
She see our faces and she smiles at us and it breaks our hearts
  
&&
  
We celebrated our 1 year anniversary
  
I still am in awe that Hubby and I have been married a whole year
  
Sometimes it feels like we have been married for years and years
  
but at the same time it feels like everything is new and fresh and exciting!
  
&&
  
We have a new little place
  
A little 2 bedroom apartment close to school
  
Even though money wise it was nice staying with my parents
  
We were so cramped!
  
So here we have lots of room for our friends and family to visit!
  
&&
  
So I promise!
  
I will keep this blog updated with photos and stories!
