So we&#8217;ve been pretty busy. =]
  
We&#8217;ve moved out of our apartment and moved in with my family to save for a down on a house.
  
We&#8217;ve gotten a new car and it got hit before we even had it for a whole month.
  
Skyler is working with my dad and Sequoia Press. His commute to work is terrible, he has to get up and walk all the way upstairs. =]
  
We decided on a name for our little princess, Paris Amora Lewis.
  
She is 7 weeks and 2 days from her big debut. Being 32 weeks pregnant is a lot of fun. =]
  
We have had a baby shower thrown by Skylers family and we got some good stuff for our little girl.
  
We are getting everything ready for Paris to come from getting diapers and even car seats and strollers! =]
  
Its funny how my big belly has drawn me and Skyler closer together and even more in love.
  
Feeling Paris move is remarkable.
  
Jack is doing good and has been really protective of me, which is kind of cute. She will be so protective of the baby I can tell already. =]
  
Much Love
