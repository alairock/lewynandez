The server crashed. Thank you google for archiving my website. Here&#8217;s what has been posted in the past with one long post.

  Okay, I know I said 5 months before, but today was the actual day of our being together.
</p>

It was a really long day at work, and it just wasnt going too good for me. I finally got off of work at around 6:30 and went straight to my apartment and showered and got ready. I went over to cynthias and I picked her up and we went to panda and we ate food. Good stuff.

After we went back to her house and we watched A Walk To Remember, my brothers favorite movie. And just cuddled. It was really really nice, especially since we havent had a lot of time to cuddle in a few weeks, cause her extended family has been down. And I must say they are all really cool!

Last week Cynthia and I went ring shopping on wednesday with my mom. We found the PERFECT ring that is freaking amazing! Then the next day we went again with her parents and grama petra! They loved the ring. After that we went to this really high class restraunt called Ruths Chris or something like that. I had a really tasty and EXPENSIVE steak. I made a huge mess. But it was good.

Anyways. I Cant believe that it has been five months! I mean, where does time go? I have spent every chance I get with ther hernandez family. They are so amazing! I mean! Very open and very loving family. They always make me so welcome in their home even when I dont feel I deserve it! They are the kind of family that everyone should know. Big Mark is a joker and very friendly, and just gives so much to me. Tish is the mom, and does a really good job at it. She is the kind of mom that I know cynthia will be for my kids. And she is really nice too! And Marky, is just neat! Little rockstar, I can already tell. Christian is a cool kid, even though I dont ever realy know whats going on with him, cause he’s such a busy body. I’m sure he and my li’l brother taylor would get along great. And then lily who is so excited for me to be her brother! She always gives me hugs and is nice and of course she does a perfect puppy dog face… which I can never say no to.

Cynthia cynthia. I can’t ever get over how amazing you are. So warm and open and honest. She really does have a heart of gold. Sometimes we cant make it over to my parents house, and she gets so sad. She doesnt really know my family too well, but she cares about them so much. It makes me so happy to see how much she cares! She is also a good cook! And she likes to make me food, and she never lets me make her anything! (I will someday soon, promise) We like to have French Vanilla’s and talk about our little Jean and give each other kisses.

Jean. Jean is my and cynthia’s little girl. No. We dont have kids yet, we’ll probably wait a while after we’re married to have kids. Too much responsibility i think. Anyways, for whatever reason, we just know we are going to have a little girl. I dont know why we both have that feeling, but we both can see it so strong that its almost like she’s here already. Little baby Jean. She likes to play with mommy, and cuddle with her when she falls asleep, keeping mom safe and warm.

As for me, I just keep going. I have secrets that I desperately want to share but unfortunately I will have to save those for a later time. :P.

Love you Cynthia. In a forever sort of way.

  So it is now the 26th of July, and we have been very happy together for 5 MONTHS! So far that is a record for both of us, and we know that it is just the beginning of a (hopefully) long forever together.
</p>

I (Skyler) am just working as much as possible so that I can buy my fiance (cynthia) her wedding ring. Im getting close. I am also working very hard at trying to get grants and, probably, loans for college this next year. Talk about tough! I am not excited to be doing the whole education thing again, but its a thing of life, and hopefully when all is said and done, I will be making big bucks!

My brother jacen is still on his mission and he just got transferred. Neat!

I still come over here to the hernandez families house every day! The family is so nice and so giving to anyone! Its just a great environment that I am happy to be around. Loving it every single day!

Thats about it for now. I’ll be on again soon for another more detailed update.

  Sadly the first post i put on here is about me being in California not with my Skyler
</p>

I miss him so bad. It feels kinda like my heart is missing.  <img src="http://i0.wp.com/lewynandez.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif?w=793" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" />actually it is missing.

Hopefully he is having fun in Utah tho.

At the moment I am in Tulare California, where I was born. Most of my family lives here in this small run down town. It isnt what it used to be from when I was little. Its being over run with gangs and drugs. Violence and other such things. It is a bit scary but my family is here so we keep coming back.

We’ve been staying with my grandma Petra and Grandpa Carl. We try and visit my moms parents Jose and Carmen as much as possible =] they feed us too much tho. Thats the only hard then when we come down is that EVERY family wants to feed us and we get a bit chubs. We’ve been visiting with my aunt anna and betsey and their families as well. Mallory has been up to no good as usual……but then again thats how i raised her….  <img src="http://i0.wp.com/lewynandez.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?w=793" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" />My aunts Carmen and Patty have been spoiling me with new clothes, lipgloss, and money. which is kinda nice. but i’d much rather be at home with my Skyler.

And to my Skyler I miss your guts boy. I cant wait to be your wife so we will never ever have to go anywhere without each other ever again, and i promise this is the last time we will be apart. PROMISE

i love you with all my heart hubby =] and i will talk to you later

love your wifey
