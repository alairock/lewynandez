Easter is tomorrow and we are SO excited to have a mini Easter egg hunt with Paris&#8230;She may even get some chocolates ðŸ˜‰
  
Sadly Hubby has had to work and didnt get to watch conference today.
  
But Paris and I got to watch ðŸ™‚ We were even joined by Lils!
  
Oh! and we got a new TV!
  
46&#8243; sheesh!
  
Its nice ðŸ™‚ We love it ðŸ™‚
  
Thats all for now!
  
See You Tomorrow!
  
Love
  
Wifey
