Its april 8th. We have been together for an official/unofficial 13 months, and things are still going great. We have 1 months till graduation, 2 for Jacen, and 3 for wedding.

This week has been extremely busy. We just booked our photographer/videographer with Lucid Media, and we booked our cake with Carries Cakes.

School is sneakin up on me, I only have one month to go, and like 2 weeks to my finals, and I am stressin out over it, but it will all be over soon, so its okay. Cynthia has two months left in High School, so of course she is stressed, and sadly I think she has been getting sick cause she is so over worked. She&#8217;s doing good otherwise I think, and we are both so excited to be getting so close to our wedding!
