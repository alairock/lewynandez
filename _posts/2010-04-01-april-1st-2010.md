What has the Little Lewis family been up to?!
  
Well Hubby got a new job
  
Paris is 10 MONTHS! 2 more months&#8230;.oh gosh.
  
And I have just been taking care of my little family.
  
We have been loving life.
  
Paris&#8217; first Easter is coming up and we got her a little tiny basket!
  
Now we just have to wait for the Easter bunny to come fill it!
  
Ummm&#8230;
  
Hubby and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary of being together! 3 years seems so short but it feel like we&#8217;ve been together for so much longer!
  
Marky and Karianna had birthdays! Which was super fun ðŸ™‚
  
I think that&#8217;s it for now&#8230;.
  
I will post pictures soon! <3 x
