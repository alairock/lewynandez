I loved our wedding day in all of it&#8217;s entirety..
  
But the past few days I&#8217;ve been thinking of the little reasons that made it so special.. 

_Here are a few.._

**To start off. I love that we were married on my Grandpa Carl&#8217;s birthday. He had unfortunately passed away a little while before we were married and this was our way of honoring him and his memory.**

**I LOVED my wedding cake! It was the ONE thing I was picky about. (And my dress which brings me to the next one&#8230;)**
