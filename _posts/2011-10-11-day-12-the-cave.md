Instead of going on her bed the normal way she likes to be &#8220;Climber Paris&#8221; and go over the rail&#8230;which gave into the abuse and snapped.

Anyways onto my secret.

One that I am currently doing right now&#8230;.as we speak&#8230;..I mean as I am typing.

I secretly love to watch _My Hubby_ sleep. Its so adorable. His cute little face! I just want to kiss it over and over again. Its a time for me to reset, often times life is so crazy and frustrating my eyes get frosted over with the stresses of life. And instead of seeing the amazing man (and handsome!) I married I sometimes see the &#8220;leaver of wet towels on the floor&#8221; or the &#8220;leaves his socks and clothes in a trail while getting ready for work&#8221; man. The times I watch him sleep I remember our happy memories and the times we just sit and laugh with each other. There really is no one in the world like **_MY_** Skyler. And I am lucky to have snatched him up before some other girl could. I am one lucky girl. And I need to always remember that.
