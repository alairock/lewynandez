Sorry we haven&#8217;t updated in so long! Our site was down!

Anyways
  
We went to the doctors for our routine 38 week checkup.During my uncomfortable pelvic exam Dr.Judd said he thought the baby was breech. So we ran down to the ultrasound tech and she confirmed baby Paris was breech. We went back to talk to Dr.Judd about our options, either trying a version or schedule a C-section. We opted for a version, so we went to Timpanogos hospital around 4:30 and they hooked me up to an IV and gave me a shot to relax my uterus muscles. Then they started pushing and pulling and&#8230;.no luck.She was stuck there. We scheduled our C-section for May 26th at 5:30 AM. So we had a three day weekend to wait through before Paris was here, Skyler had memorial day off. We went fishing that night before the C-section to calm our nerves, and since I couldn&#8217;t eat anything spicy for the next few months and I couldn&#8217;t eat past midnight Skyler got me a whole box of hot wings. And I finished them right before midnight. And I fell asleep even though I only slept for 3 hours. I got up made sure everything was in place and ready to go, did my make up and slept with my parents in their bed for a little while before Skyler got up and we left. We said a prayer and off we went into the hospital. I changed and got hooked up to my IV, the monitored Paris and around 7:30 AM they would come get me to get my spinal tap. The sad part was that Skyler couldn&#8217;t come with me, I had to do it alone. They took me in and I was so scared, the nurse was so nice she held my hand as the man numbed my back then I felt the pressure of the big needle. After that everything went numb, they put me down on the table and washed me up. The man who gave me my numbing shot was so nice he put my head on a pillow and kept talking to me. They put a curtain infront of me and Skyler came in he held my hand and it all began&#8230;I felt pushing and pulling then I heard them say &#8220;babies out&#8221; Me and Skyler were so anxious to hear her little cry. It was the most amazing sound ever! We both cried, and I wanted to know if everything was okay. And that was around the last thing I remember. They gave me some weird drugs, and I was out. In and out for that whole day. I went into the recovery room where all of Skyler&#8217;s family was. I saw my mom and dad; my mom told me that Paris looked perfect and that she had dark hair. My nose itched and I wanted an Oreo REALLY bad. My nurse told me that if she gave me the oreo i would throw up. She gave it to me and of course&#8230;I threw it up. I kept itching my nose and the itch wouldnt go away. I finally got to hold my baby but my arms were to weak to hold her for very long. I had to give her back up. But that night she slept in my bed all night long. Since I had lost so much blood during the surgery I had to get a blood infusion. Which was really weird. And poor baby Paris had jaundice. But we got better and we eventually got to go home! It was an amazing experience and we are so happy to finally have our baby with us. It was nice to have all sorts of friends and family visit us and our little baby. Skyler even counted our baby&#8217;s first sneezes! and change her tar diapers! It was funny to watch him!
