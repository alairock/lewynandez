You were quiet, kept to yourself , and often times sat alone. All the kids were lined up outside the classroom to go in when you showed up. All your hair was gone and it was now really short. Most of us looked and didn&#8217;t say anything.  But a few idiot boys did. They were always the loud rowdy ones in class and now they started teasing you. Saying you looked ugly and like a boy. I watched as you tried to hide behind people keeping your face down. But that did not stop them. They kept laughing and teasing, and you began to cry. You cried and cried and they did not stop. I was so furious, but so timid. I was afraid to say anything and have things said to me. I wasn&#8217;t strong enough. Years have passed since then and the moments of you crying were burned into me, haunted me really.  I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore. I stood up for people since then. But you will always live with me in my heart. Because of you I no longer just sit in the back of the crowd, I stand up and say something. I am no longer afraid of the backlash because I throw it right back into their faces. I was not strong enough then but I am strong enough now. All because of you. I can stand up for you and everyone else too.
