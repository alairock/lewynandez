We have all been sick lately! Except Lauren thank goodness!! I&#8217;m sitting here watching Tangled with Paris and Lauren while Hubby is in the bath. We are waiting for Hubby to go to the doctor at 2:50. One things for sure though. At least we have each other! Being sick would really suck if we didn&#8217;t have each other to lean on. Even though we are all sick we still have little moments that remind us that we are so lucky to be a family of 4. Like going to the lake (the Princess Lake as Paris calls it) and watching the sun set together. And as the sun sets behind the mountain the memory is burned into our hearts, having our two young daughters in our arms watching God paint the sky. x
