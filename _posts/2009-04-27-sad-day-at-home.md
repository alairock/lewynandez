Today was especially crazy. Started out fairly normal, woke up really late, went to church. Midway through a meeting I noticed cynthia&#8217;s finger was especially wider than normal above where her wedding rings were. I told her that we needed to take them off right away when we got home. Well we tried that, and on trying to get them off we bruised her finger up a bit, made her swell even more and was completely unable to take them off altogether. 

I started to do frantic online research about peoples experiences with this situation. It was either we hurt her trying to get it off or we cut it off. I found several resources that said they have to cut the ring a lot of times to resize it anyways, so really if we did cut it off it could be repaired. 

I called the nearest fire house and asked if they would do it for us, and they were more than willing to at no charge. It took about 10 minutes for them to cut it and ply them apart, but after it was all done, they got it off. 

Now we are going to Shane Co where hopefully this is covered under warranty (or we&#8217;ll just have to pay for the repair) tomorrow. Get it fixed and re-plated. Put them back in a box, and wait for baby to come!!! Ill post pictures of her hand and the ring later tonight or tomorrow.

Okay, thats it for now! Bai!
