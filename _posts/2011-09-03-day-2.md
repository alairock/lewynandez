**Day 02- A picture of something(s) you cannot live without.**

Yeah I cheated and have 3 things I can&#8217;t live without. But it is completely true, especially now more than ever. ( I had a seizure last night. Scaring the life out of my husband.) Not seeing my husband and daughters when I finally came to in the ambulance was the worst feeling in the world. Those three amazing people I am blessed to call family have such extraordinary personalities. And they bring such joy into my life. Life would be so boring without them. I love you guys, you are my life.
