So we have completed graduation. it was so nerve-racking but it was amazing having all my friends and family there even my uncle carl showed up. he had to cancel an appointment just so he could be there. =]

we have 3 days till Jacen. which is kind of exciting, I&#8217;ve never met him before so its like&#8230;&#8230;.I dunno what its like. But Skyler is really excited to have his brother home.

we have 4 weeks till the wedding. less than one month in days. =] the families are busy trying to wrap things up and we are on crunch time now! trying to get favors and family dresses and tuxes and flowers and music and ITS ALL COMING SO FAST!!!! =]we are getting really excited! I also got a crap job to get some money for skylers upgrade tungsten ring and some clothes for our honeymoon. =] along with things like makeup and junk like that i will need while we are gone. we are also looking for a place to live that will let us keep our little Jacksie with us.
