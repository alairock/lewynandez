So, we are just starting to push off the dock with this whole wedding planning thing.

I think its just getting to realize what you have to do to really get going, so Mommy and Pappa Nandez started a list of things we need to get done between now and our wedding, so that we know what we need to do, so it looks like we are going to start putting check marks next to the things on the list finally! So yeah, neat!

So far, we havent done anything, but save the date cards, and choose colors. It was pink, but now we are thinking it will be brown and blue. So yeah, thats cool, and so it will be neat to color cordinate things with those colors.

Umm&#8230;. This last month has been a hard month, just emotionally, lots of stress with school and work and things like that. But really I just think that its the weather outside. Its just dumping snow on us like crazy! So, it makes the mood kinda bad from the start, but cheer up, summer is on its way!

Also Jacen(my brother) is coming home from his LDS mission in less than 5 months!!!! So, lots of exciting things to look foreward to!
