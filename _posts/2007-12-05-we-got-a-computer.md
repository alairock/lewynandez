So its been quite a while since we&#8217;ve posted!

We are finally officially engaged!

Skyler proposed to me September 8th our 6 month anniversary! WOW

He took me to temple square and we went on a cutesy little carriage ride =]

He even bought a way expensive shirt for the fancy date

Anywho he took me in front of the temple and BLAM!!! just like that i was laughing hysterically

My ring is beautiful and i love it dearly (we will probably put pictures up soon)

On the down side my grandpa pasted away since we last wrote on here

And Skyler drove all the way to california by himself to be with me for my grandpa&#8217;s funeral

Now we are coming up on our 9 months

Skyler turned 20 and I turned 18

We are going to 2 AWESOME CONCERTS THIS MONTH!!!

Shiny Toy Guns

and Iron and Wine the band that plays our song,

we got a computer from my parents to both of us so alot more will be coming

Mom is way excited about our wedding now and she even wants to hire a wedding planner! WOW

so wedding stuff will be on its way quickly

much love
