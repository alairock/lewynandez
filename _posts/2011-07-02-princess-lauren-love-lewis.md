Lauren Love Lewis arrived on June 11, 2011 at 10:20 PM weighing in at 7 lbs 15 oz 20 in long.

Friday June 10 I started working out in our house with Paris, running up and down stairs, jumping jacks, even some Capoeira. Around 1:00 PM I started getting contractions but they werent long enough or far enough apart to do anything. So I had to sit and wait..and wait&#8230;Skyler came home around 3 PM and started cleaning the house. After we went to Wal Mart to get some last minute things and got dinner. I tried to rest in between contractions while we watched movie after movie..TV show after TV show. Finally we put Paris to bed and started watching Lie to Me. My contractions were getting closer almost 5 mins apart. I called my mom and she started heading over with my little sister Lily. When they got there they sent me and Skyler off to bed and they fell asleep on the couch. I could barely sleep my contractions were getting more intense. I would wake up every 5 mins and I would shake Skyler&#8217;s sleeping body while my contraction went on. I tried everything I knew of to lessen the pain. Walking, taking a bath. Finally the contractions were too intense and too close to ignore. I called our midwife and they gave us the okay to head to the birthing center. So we gathered our stuff and left around 3:30 AM. When we got there and checked me I was only dilated to like a 3, and little miss Lauren wasnt turned the right way. So we waited and waited&#8230;getting to a 4 dilated. Trying to sleep in between contractions. The pain was getting worse but stillÂ manageable. I got in the nice jetted tub at the birthing center and tried to relax more in the tub for about an hour or so. Finally when I got out they checked me again and I jumped from a 4 to a 7!! I was so excited! I thought that I was on the downward slope and that Lauren would be here in a few hours maybe! But hours went by laying in the tub or trying to get some sleep. The contractions were so intense and my body was getting so exhausted. I was so extremely grateful to have Skyler there to squeeze onto when the contractions would come, when they would check me for dilation Skyler would put his forehead on mine and I would pull on his hair because it was so painful. Around 1:00 PM they check me for dilation again..I was still a 7. I had gone 5 hours without dilating any!! Hearing that my body gave up..I was so exhausted (I had been in labor 24 hours at this point) I could not handle the pain anymore. So we transferred to the Provo Hospital. The ride there was the longest ride of my life! Once we got there the midwives wheeled me in on a wheel chair while Skyler parked the car and brought our stuff in. Once I got into the delivery room everything flew by. While still doing some of my paper work and asking me the mundane questions they gave me an epidural and broke my water. There were so many people in the room at that time. When the broke my water however they found that Lauren had pooped in her little water world. The doctor on call kept insisting on us having a C-Section but I wanted to have her the normal way. So once again we waited to see if breaking my water would make me dilate quicker. I had gone from a 7 to a 3 when they broke my water. Hours later no change, thats when they brought out the pitocin. I was finally dilating! And getting some rest thanks to the epidural. The doctor kept telling me if I was too tired or felt like my body had had too much I could always get the C-Section, I wanted to tell him &#8220;I&#8217;ve come this far fool! I aint givin up now!&#8221; Seriously! I had gone close to 30 hours of labor to just give up and get sliced open!? Not gonna happen! 9 hours after we arrived at the hospital it was finally time to push! I was so excited but afraid I wasn&#8217;t going to push right! Besides do you know how heavy your legs are when you cant feel them?! Maybe 25 minutes of pushing later and out came perfect little Lauren! Screaming already. We cried hearing her beautiful little cries, seeing her perfect little body. 5 fingers on each hand and 5 toes on each little foot. They took her right to the table where the NeoNatal Team checked her little lungs, thankfully she hadn&#8217;t taken anything in. After the team did their work and I was all stitched up they placed Lauren on my chest while Skyler went to go get Paris. (She was in the waiting room with my family) Paris was the first person to see Lauren, and she immediately gave her a kiss and told her &#8220;Hi sister.&#8221; We got to have a few minutes alone as a family of 4 before my family came in. It was amazing. We felt complete. We didn&#8217;t have Lauren the way we planned but she got here safely and thats all we care about. We have 2 perfect daughters and we could not be any more blessed.
