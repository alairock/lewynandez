I had been working really hard, trying to find a way to drive traffic to dryearth.com, until about the time of my last post. After which I decided that I wanted to work with Utahbands.com and reform it in a big way, converting it to a full scale social network. The details of the network are being guarded closely, but it&#8217;s going to be epic.

With building that site, I have learned that I have a lot of limitations as far as my knowledge in programming. Since the remodel, I have relearned html, including new standards with HTML5 and CSS3 (More than I knew before, anyways) I have come a long way in Jquery as well. I can write JQuery really efficiantly now. I can&#8217;t say I know it all, but I can do anything I think I could ever want to do with it.

PHP I began learning years and years ago. Because of my stint as a designer, I never fully developed my skills in PHP. I always could write it, but in a very blocky way, where if I wanted a task done, I would write the code from top to bottom. No functions, no classes. After redundantly programming the site in my usual blocky style, I noticed my code was&#8230; well&#8230; less than efficient.  If I were to hire someone to assist in my code, they might laugh and turn around running. This lead me to go back to my basics and really learn everything over again. The right way this time.

I dove into OOP &#8211; Object Oriented PHP.  Long (long) story short, I rebuilt the website about 3 times in hopes to allow other authors the opportunity to get involved with the project. Now it&#8217;s really cooking. The website takes a lot less time to build and hopefully I will be able to get a few other programmers interested about the project.
