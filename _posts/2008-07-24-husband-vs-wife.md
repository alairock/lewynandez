So we are now married. Its strange a little. Everything feels the same yet everything is really different. We had an amazing time in california, doing things like going to Coronado Island across the big scary bridge, going to the San Diego Zoo, Going to SeaWorld, Going to LegoLand, Going to an underground Albertsons, going somewhat to the Wild Animal Park, and learning that people in California drive like maniacs.

The wedding was perfect. It was the most beautiful wedding I have ever seen with my own eyes. Thank you to everyone that made it so amazing. Especially thanks to Barlow and his wife at Lucid Media who video and photographed the entire thing. They made it really fun and really interesting for both of us. I personally recommend them for any one elses video/photo needs.

Thank you to all my family, on both sides who came long distances to support us, and to all friends who came. You all are appreciated and made San Diego way less stressful with your generosity. So thank you all for being so amazing friends and family. You really helped us start out strong.

Right now we are just getting our house in order, organizing cleaning, learning to cook and learning to become a team. I found I am really organized, but when it comes to my clothes I just throw things around. lol. Its crazy when you are on your own, you start to see what your parents have taught you has really come through all along. I actually do the dishes. And regularly. I know! I mean if you have ever seen me at my house, I just let things go all the time, but now that I am on my own, I actually take responsibility! Thanks mum and dad. Looks like I turned out after all! lol.

Anyways, we have the family campout next week, but because of work, we can only really go thursday night and sleep over on friday. So for the rest of you, I really hope that all of you have fun!

Also, I would like to make a special thanks to my Granma Hill for providing us with the hotel in San Diego, and to my parents for sea world, and Aunt Suzy for Legoland! It wouldnt have been the same honey moon without you! Also thanks to everyone for their generous gifts and donations!

Oh, and one last thing, thank you Cynth&#8217;s Parents for getting our house in order, the desk, the table, the groceries and everything was really awesome! I can&#8217;t thank you enough.

Love ya&#8217;ll.
