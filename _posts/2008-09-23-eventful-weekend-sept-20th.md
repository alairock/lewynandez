So we had a very exciting weekend

We went to Tucanos Saturday night with Mark and Beth,

My parents even let us drive the BMW

I LOVE that car.

It was a delicious dinner and I had a record of 15 chicken hearts.

Later on in the evening Adam and Jaime called us to see if we wanted to go to some hot springs in Heber with them.

We figured we would just stay the night in Heber since we made a bit of money.

So we packed and overnight bag and were off!

The hotsprings was an amazing experience and you could see the stars really well.

We then drove to down to a Holiday Inn and fell asleep quickly.

The next morning we were off to Park City!

We loved looking around and eating dinner at my favorite pizza place there.

They even had a Sunday market we went to look at.

It was like a mini vacation which is nice to go and get away from the stress of life.

much love
