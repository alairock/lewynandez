We went to a doctors appointment on Wednesday, everything is going good. ðŸ™‚

While at the doctors they tried to get the baby&#8217;s heartbeat but she kept hiding. ðŸ™‚ when they did find her she kept kickin the microphone&#8230; ðŸ™‚ i guess she doesnt want anyone to invade in on her sleep. ðŸ™‚

2 more weeks till we find out if its a boy or a girl and we are pretty excited.

I can feel the baby&#8217;s heart and see it too! when i lay down and suck in my belly&#8230;..she probably doesnt like that i squish her but its still fun to see ðŸ˜€

As life goes we are doin pretty well, my birthday passed on the 28th. Being 19 is kinda odd. BUT I got a nice new camera for my birthday and our photography business can get on its way.

Life isnt really that big and exciting&#8230;we are mostly centered on working and spending time enjoying each others company ðŸ™‚

Skyler is being such a great husband. ðŸ™‚ he takes care of me and buys me my cravings as they come. he even got up at 6 AM and made me a sandwhich. how cute is that?! ðŸ™‚ i love him so much and appreciate all he does for me and our growing little family.

Until next time mis amigos.
