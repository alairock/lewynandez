I have so much going on…. I dont know if I really want to talk about it all. Its kind of exciting all the things that has been going on. Its one thirty in the morning and I am at my friend brookes house bein bored.

This whole last month went by so fast! Not alot happened I think. I have spent as much time with my amazing girlfriend. We have almost been together for two months! AND NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER! I cannot even believe we have gone so perfect. Every single girlfriend I have ever had there has been problems almost immediately, but with her its just the opposite! Everytime I see her I think our relationship keeps on just getting stronger.

I have also been getting even more and more close to her family too. I have been doing alot with them, and just last saturday we went to Duchene to see their property where they are building a cabin. It was amazing! They got me sick, but it was worth it!

Oh, and one last thing I am moving out tomorrow! I still have not yet met my room mates, but I’m excited to, but I am mostly excited for cable television and hot tub.

Alright. I am going to bed. Good night. (Cynthia, if and when you read this, I love you so much! Ima marry you!)
