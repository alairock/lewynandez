So my birthday was a few days ago
  
And I had so much fun!
  
Skyler spoiled me so bad!
  
He got me an iPhone 4 a few days before my birthday.. Which I love!!
  
The night before I had to stay up till midnight and only sleep till 4(for my EEG) so Skyler sang Happy Birthday to me in my ear as I drifted off to sleep. The next morning we went to my EEG..not so fun. But the nurse was so nice and gave me a little goody basket because she felt bad that I had to do the test on my birthday. After the test Skyler took me to Starbucks for some yummy drinks then we rushed home to our girls. We picked them up and went to breakfast..I had yummy biscuits and gravy with some bacon..mm! After that we returned home so I could have a small nap, after my nap Skyler took me to see Breaking Dawn&#8230;we ended up throwing popcorn at each other half of the movie. Haha. After the movie ended we went home so I could get in my fancy outfit for dinner. We had a nice quiet dinner at Carrabbas, we shared a sirloin Marsala mmm! After dinner skyler took us home for my awesome Hello Kitty cake and ice cream. We tried to keep the evening nice and quiet because the last time we had a birthday I had a seizure and ruined it. 

Oh I wanted to mention how Skyler gave me my phone! Cause it was so clever and cute! I was waiting for him to come home (he had been helping my dad with a work meeting) and for some reason my phone stopped getting texts and wouldn&#8217;t let me call anyone. It kept saying &#8220;Not registered on network.&#8221; I was like what the heck!? Then lily came up to me and Skyler was like &#8220;I&#8217;ve been texting and calling you why haven&#8217;t you replied?!&#8221; I told him the problems I was having with it and he told me he would take a look at it. Fast forward to right before dinner time. My dad and Skyler were home and Skyler started looking at my phone. My dad told him &#8220;Here Skyler let me call it and see what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; so he starts calling it and all of a sudden the generic iPhone ringtone starts ringing out from Skyler&#8217;s pocket. He was like &#8220;What is this?!&#8221; and pulls an iPhone 4 out of his pocket. I was so surprised I almost cried. Haha well played boys.
