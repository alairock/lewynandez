In case you haven&#8217;t heard..

**Baby #2 is on their way!**

And let me tell you&#8230;

It was the hardest decision of my life!

Way harder than deciding to have little Paris..

I cried for days

And I prayed for days

I talked it over with Skyler many MANY times

But I kept feeling like I wouldn&#8217;t love Paris the same

And that I wouldn&#8217;t give her the same attention..

So one day..

I called my dad..

Who told me exactly what I needed to hear.

_He knew_ I was capable of great things.

And a **great love** that could grow _with out end_.

_And then&#8230;.._

**It all clicked for me**

Growing up Mom and Dad always had more hugs and kisses to give

More **&#8220;I Love You&#8221;** &#8216;s to go around

Even when our family grew

There was _always_ more room in their arms

_Always_ another spot on their bed

Even as their kids grew up

And even though one of them was now married with a child of _her_ own

There was always love there for everyone

And my siblings ended up being some of the best friends I have

Because **&#8220;When All Your Friends Are Gone Your Family Is Always Gonna Be There&#8221;**

And I want Paris to have that

Another great love I remembered was

The love of my heavenly father has

He loves **all** his children

And through all the faces in the crowd

He remembers _MINE_

And because of his great love for me

I am able to know love and to have such amazing miracles in my life

And when I go to heavenly father when I have moments of doubt he comforts me

I know _(like one of my favorite songs says..)_ **&#8220;Nothings gonna change my world&#8221;**

My world will just get bigger

After all&#8230;

_I will have my strawberry fields forever_ ;]
