Well we have been married for 2 months now and we absolutely love it!

Its an amazing feeling waking up next to your spouse and having someone there in the morning. Putting your cold feet on their warm legs in the morning. ðŸ™‚

Skyler totally boss, he is the cheese to my macaroni. =] Skyler is such a great husband, he takes such good care of me.

We recently had Matt over at our house and we made some yummy salsa for him. ðŸ™‚ Marky Cade Menor and Andrea showed up too. ðŸ™‚ It was a fun night.

There are rumors that we are pregnant, and we have had tons of people texting us wondering if it was true&#8230;.so here is the truth&#8230;&#8230;.WE DONT KNOW YET!! We might be but we dont know and we wont know until the end of the month. So dont fret loves if we find out you will too soon find out.

thanks for all the good laughs
