    This post here is partly a rebuttle to what my girlfriend posted just a minute ago and some going on’s in my life up to this point. Those who have been reading, probably dont care, but this is for all of you anyways.

    Â I have been extremely busy this last month! Where to even begin! The start ofÂ march was awesome! I went to four amazing showsÂ a victim effect show (where I first met cynthia!) Then later on I saw underoath, which by the way I regret I didnt post a review on sixteenink.com,Â then Anberlin, which are amazing if you ever get the chance. and then another victim effect show with my girlfriend cynthia. Crazy that all of this happend in the month of march. Not really the concerts but some amazing friendships I have made.

    I have come to really enjoy my time with the Hernandez’s (my girlfriend’s family, as well as my boss’s). They are all amazing people with an excellent sense of music, and enjoyment of life. I am so lucky I found them.

    LittleÂ Mark is an awesome kid, who unfortunately knows I am tickelish. I dont wrestle with anyone usually, but for this kid I make an exception. I kick his trash, when he’s not looking, Oh yeah!

    Â Cynthia is my awesome girlfriend. I know I’m not good enough for her, but she loves me anyways, and we are killer tight! We’ll probably end up getting married, but dont tell no one yet.Â  She has an amazing personality. She’s soft spoken usually, but only cause she doesnt know you. When you do, its like walking into a well lit room. You really notice her, cause she just shines with her amazing awesome personality (she’s also very attractive, so yeah, the rooms always gets brighter with her in it).

    The first day I met her, I didnt say a whole lot to her, but in the month that I have known her we have become instantanious best friends, and I just dont see an end to our friendship. Probably a goodthing, as I am dating her now! WOOT! But then we returned to the school of music for an encore of victim effect, and its crazy how much she just gets into the music and loves the scene as much as I do, maybe more?! (if thats possible) She even got me to go up on stage and dance around with her. Sweet! I have alot more to say, but I think that is going to have to just do it.

    Cory on the other hand has decided to leave me and the band for 4 months while he is in DC selling stuff. Its lame! But when he gets back, we are going to hit the studio, like we planned to this month, get some stuff recorded and get some killer shows to come your way. Be excited, and be patient. I know you all have been looking foreward to our return for sometime. The end is near, but not too near.

    I miss everyone, and I miss posting on this board. I am going to start up again, and you will see more conversations with annoying people, as well as my frustrations, and even my happiness, if you can stand any more of it.

    Â On a last note. The guy who invented Orange Chicken needs a statue built for him. One in which we can worship. I think it was jesus. Because only jesus can make food so good, right?

    Oh, I know he’ll never read this, but thanks Big Mark for the most amazing food at Tucanos. For those who havent gone, go cause its the best food ever.
