Created a new user on this, in an attempt to make this blog a &#8216;family&#8217; blog and keep it better organized. You will see my posts at lewynandez.com/skyler and cynthia&#8217;s posts at lewynandez.com/cynthia. As the girls get older, they will be able to post on their own pages.
  
I have been working really hard to improve my design skills, and learn how to better implement modern xhtml css3 sites, which are search engine friendly and inviting.

I have also been learning Perl, which fortunately is just enough like PHP that it&#8217;s been more fun to learn, than a chore.

That&#8217;s it for me. Cynthia should be back to catch up on her posts!
