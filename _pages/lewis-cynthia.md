# Cynthia

Hello Hello Hello! My name is Cynthia Renae Lewis and I am a newlywed wifey. =] I absolutely love being married to Skyler B. Lewis, and I love him more than anything in this world! I love pink and hello kitty! Kelsey Belliston is my best friend ever! I love to eat hot wings and sushi. Me and Skyler have a Chihuahua named Jack and a kitten named Sasha. I love being a wife and I cannot imagine what life would be like without Skyler. He is my best friend and I know without a doubt he will always love me no matter what. I want to go to school to become a lawyer, and eventually a senator. I will (hopefully) study immigration law (and constitutional law) at the BYU law school under direction from my great Uncle Carl! I love my family more than anything, Mom Dad Marky Christian Lily mean the world to me and they are all people I consider to be my best friends also. I look up to every one of them. I love spending time with Skyler, some of my favorite days is when he makes me food and we watch a movie from the comfort of our bed. =] I love the cold days in and the warm days out. I love taking Skyler out and showing him off in public.
